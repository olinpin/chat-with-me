Avoid distraction: By using text without meaning, the viewer's attention is kept on the design rather than the content being displayed.

Modern use: It gained popularity in the 1960s with Letraset sheets and was further popularized by desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker. How it works Scrambled text: The original Latin words are manipulated and rearranged. Mimics real text: The resulting text looks like natural language with varied word lengths and a typical frequency of letters and punctuation, even though it's not real Latin.
